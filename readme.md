# Ardite
Ardite is a highly flexible no-SQL and immutable database.

## Development Roadmap
This database wonâ€˜t be considered feature complete (at least for now) until 2.0, but it will be considered ready for production testing at 1.0.

### 1.0: To be completed late summer 2016
- [ ]: Ledger Service.
- [ ]: View Service.

### 2.0: To be completed late summer 2017
- [ ]: Data Schemas.
- [ ]: Roles and Permissions.

## Inspiration
- [Turning the database inside out](http://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/), a must read to understand what Ardite is aiming to be.
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org) for an early client side reference of many ideas found in Ardite.
- [JSON Schema](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03), [JSON Patch](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902), [JSON Pointer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901), and [JSON-LD](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) helped define the Ardite data interface.
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) for being a feature rich database to look up to.
